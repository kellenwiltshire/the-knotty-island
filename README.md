			Website created for The Knotty Island, an online handmade Macrame Etsy store. The site was designed and created using NextJS utilizing the Etsy API. There is a small server created with NodeJS and Express to manage the API requests. The website was built and functions according the Client's Request and within the limitation of the API. This was the first website I created without the help of a course or tutorial and was a major learing experience along the way. Instead of using Create React App, I used NextJS as it allowed for better page creation along with better performance for Search Engines. The back-end is hosted with Heroku and functions as a way to securely call Etsy API. The front-end is hosted with Vercel.
